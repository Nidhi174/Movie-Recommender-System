# Movie Recommender System

This movie recommender system is a machine learning project designed to help users discover new movies they might enjoy based on their preferences and viewing history. It employs collaborative filtering techniques to make personalized movie recommendations.



## Features

- **User-Based Recommendations**: The system suggests movies based on the user's viewing history and preferences.
- **Item-Based Recommendations**: Users receive movie recommendations similar to the movies they've liked or watched.
- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines both user-based and item-based approaches for enhanced accuracy.
- **User Profiles**: Allows users to create profiles and update their preferences for better recommendations.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific movies and get detailed information.

##Tools/Technologies Used
-**JupyterNotebook and PyCharm
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for building the recommender system.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end of the web application.
